# vCloud Director

[vCloud Director (vCD)](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-director/) is cloud management tool from VMWare that acts as an overlay on top of vSphere, providing users with a self-service GUI and API. vCloud Director enables service providers to offer Infrastructure as a Service to their customers by providing users with direct control of virtual machine provisioning, and some aspects of networking.

## vCloud Limitations

With vCD most network functionality is delivered by the VMWare vShield Edge (vSE) virtual appliance. Unfortunately certain key network operations can only be performed by the service provider and are not available to users. They include:

* deploying a vSE

* connecting a vSE to an external network

* sub-allocating external IP addresses to a vSE

All other common network operations are accesible to users, however many of them are limited to users with the [Organization Administrator](https://pubs.vmware.com/vca/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vcloud.api.doc_56%2FGUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html) role assigned to them.
